Overview
--------

RZ/G3S board is designed to start different systems on cores. It uses Yocto as the build system
to build Linux system and BootLoaders to run Linux on CA55 core.

The provided Yocto layer is an enhancement on top of Reneass FSP build see `Linux Start-up Guide for RZ/G3S Board Support Package`_.
And it will build the following artifacts in the directory `build/tmp/deploy/images/smarc-rzg3s`:

* RZ/G3S Linux kernel: Image-smarc-rzg3s.bin
* Device tree file: Image-r9a08g045s33-smarc.dtb
* root filesystem: <image name>-smarc-rzg3s.tar.bz2
* L2 Boot loader for SPI: bl2_bp_spi-smarc-rzg3s.srec
* L2 Boot loader for eMMC: bl2_bp_emmc-smarc-rzg3s.srec
* L3 Boot loader: fip-smarc-rzg3s.srec
* Flash Writer: FlashWriter-smarc-rzg3s.mot
* SD image: core-image-<image name> -smarc-rzg3s.wic.gz
* BMAP image: core-image-<image name> -smarc-rzg3s.wic.bmap

``NOTE`` <image-name> can be either `core-image-minimal` or `core-image-bsp`.

The top-level meta-layer is `meta-rz-zephyr`, please see README.md file for details: `meta-rz-zephyr`_.

.. _meta-rz-zephyr: https://gitbud.epam.com/rec-rzzp/meta-zephyr-rz/-/blob/rzg3s_dev/README.md

Compatibility
-------------

This Yocto build is based on top of RZ/G3S Board Support Package Version 1.0.0 (`Linux Start-up Guide for RZ/G3S Board Support Package`_)
with ``meta-rz-features`` layer provided with Multi-OS Package v2.0.0. Please note that current release is based
on Multi-OS Package v2.0.0 and do not support Multi-OS-Package v2.0.1.

Current Yocto repo provides the following changes to the Renesas yocto recipes:

* trusted-firmware-a: Add `PLAT_M33_BOOT_SUPPORT=1` to start CM33 core on boot;
* rpmsg-sample_0.1: Updates to rpmsg-sample code to work with newer versions of OpenAMP;
* linux-renesas_5.10: Update kernel CPG driver to enable SCIF and OSTM clocks for Zephyr;
* u-boot_2021.10: Disable sdhi2 device as it shares scif1 pin used by Cortex-M33 core.

Getting started with Yocto
--------------------------

Initialize yocto repository:

.. code-block:: bash

    repo init -u git@gitbud.epam.com:rec-rzzp/rzg3s-manifest.git -b manifest_init
    repo sync

``NOTE`` Yocto initialization using repo for manifests. Please follow the link for repo installation details: `repo Install`_.

.. _repo Install: https://gerrit.googlesource.com/git-repo#install

Before building please install all needed packages, provided in *Section 2.1 Building images*
in `Linux Start-up Guide for RZ/G3S Board Support Package`_.

Initializate bitbake environment using command:

.. code-block:: bash

    TEMPLATECONF=$PWD/meta-zephyr-rz/docs/template/conf  source poky/oe-init-build-env

Start the build:

.. code-block:: bash

    MACHINE=smarc-rzg3s bitbake core-image-minimal

The above commands will clone all necessary repositories, generate necessary configuration files
and run build.

All built files will be located in directory `/build/tmp/deploy/images/smarc-rzg3s`.

**NOTE** BL2 TF-A image will be built with `PLAT_M33_BOOT_SUPPORT` feature to load image to CM33 core on boot.

.. _Flash loaders:

Flash loaders to the target board
---------------------------------

To Flash bootloaders to the target board please follows this steps:

* Switch the board to SCIF Download mode. Refer to :ref:`SCIF boot`.
See section 4.1.1 of `Linux Start-up Guide for RZ/G3S Board Support Package`_ for details.

* Connect to the board minicom consoles using minicom (:ref:`Linux minicom terminal`);
* When the following message appear:

.. code-block:: bash

    SCI Download mode (Notmal SCI boot)
    -- Load Program to SRAM -----------------

* Use minicom `ASCII` mode to upload FlashWriter (FlashWriter-smarc-rzg3s.mot).
Refer to :ref:`Upload with minicom`;

* After upload the following message appear:

.. code-block:: bash

.. _Upload with minicom:

Upload with minicom
```````````````````

For upload file with mimicom press `Ctrl+a` then `s`. In menu choose `ascii` then file to upload.

.. _Start Linux:

Starting Linux on the target board
----------------------------------

This step is optional for all Zephyr tests referenced in this document, except for :ref:`rz_g3s_openamp`.

For :ref:`rz_g3s_openamp` this step is mandatory.

To load Linux rootfs microSD card should be used.

Please plug in micro SD card to your PC and then execute:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo bmaptool copy core-image-minimal-smarc-rzg3s.wic.gz /dev/sda

From `/build/tmp/deploy/images/smarc-rzg3s` folder where `/dev/sda` is the device associated with microSD card.
See section 3.1 of `Linux Start-up Guide for RZ/G3S Board Support Package`_ for details.

Then plug this microSD card to slot on carry board. Schema is provided in Section 5 of `Linux Start-up Guide for RZ/G3S Board Support Package`_.

Hit reset.
