I2C Bus Interface (I2C)
=======================

I2C overview
------------

The Renesas RZ G3S Soc has 4 channels of the I2C bus interface (RIIC).

Refer to "I2C Bus Interface" section in "Renesas RZ/G3S Group Userâ€™s Manual: Hardware"

I2C driver overview
-------------------

Zephyr RZ/G3S Renesas I2C driver provides Zephyr :ref:`i2c_api` System interface implementation.

The I2C subsystem is **not** enabled by default in ``rz_g3s_defconfig``. To enable Zephyr
I2C functionality and RZ G3S I2C driver below Kconfig options have to be enabled:

.. code-block:: text

    CONFIG_I2C=y
    /* automatically enabled */
    CONFIG_I2C_RIIC=y

The RZ G3S I2C driver code can be found at:

.. code-block:: text

    drivers/i2c/i2c_riic.c

Current implementation of I2C driver supports DMA transfer. Currently DMA used if amount of
transferred bytes more then 6 for read and more then 1 for write.

DMA transfer capability in RZ G3C I2C driver below Kconfig options have to be enabled:

.. code-block:: text

    CONFIG_I2C_RIIC_DMA_DRIVEN=y

I2C testing
-----------

samples/sensor/bme280
`````````````````````

BME280 sensor (or any I2C device) can be connected to the PMOD1_6A connector as shown on picture:

   :height: 350px
   :align: center

Zephyr RZ/G3S I2C driver can be tested by using **bme280** sample application with BME280 sensor.
To build **bme280** test run command:

.. code-block:: bash

    west build -b rz_g3s -p always samples/sensor/bme280

Console output:

.. code-block:: console

    [00:00:00.038,000] <dbg> BME280: bme280_chip_init: "bme280@76" OK

To build **bme280** test run command with DMA support:

.. code-block:: bash

    west build -b rz_g3s -p always samples/sensor/bme280 -S rz-g3s-i2c-dma

Console output looks the same as above.
