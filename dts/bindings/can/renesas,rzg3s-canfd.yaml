  Renesas RZ G3S CAN-FD controller bindings. The RZ G3S is 2-channel CAN-FD module (CAN-FD) that
  complies with ISO 11898-1 (2015) Standards. It transmits and receives both formats of messages:
  the standard identifier (11 bits) and extended ID (29 bits).
  - number of receive rules (0 to 128) for each channel
  - transmit buffers up to 32 per channel;
  - receive buffers 128 total, up to 64 buffers per channel;
  - Transmitter Delay Compensation;
  - RX/TX message timestamping.

        The only provided "tx-delay-comp-offset" is used if "tx-delay-comp-offset-only" is provided.
        RZ G3S CAN-FD controller supports Transmitter Delay Compensation (TDC) and, by default, the
        TDC is applied as "tx-delay-comp-offset" + CFDCnFDSTS.TDCR.
        Where
        - "tx-delay-comp-offset" is provided by user in CAN channel DLL clock cycles and
        stored in CFDCnFDCFG.TDCO (TDCO + 1 value is applied).
        - CFDCnFDSTS.TDCR is the measured Transceiver Delay Compensation Result
      type: boolean
