    description: |
      Total number of native chip selects.
      Hardware limitations related to chip selects:
        - When using GPIO chip selects, at least one native chip select must
          be left unused, as it will be driven anyway.

  dmas:
    description: |
      Optional TX & RX dma specifiers. Mandatory if defined CONFIG_SPI_ASYNC
      Each specifier will have a phandle reference to the dmac controller,
      the channel number, slot and config.

      For example dmas for TX, RX on SPI0:
         dmas = <&dma0 1 DMA_RS_SPTI0 0>, <&dma0 0 DMA_RS_SPRI0 0>;

  dma-names:
    description: |
      Required if the dmas property exists.  This should be "tx" and "rx"
      to match the dmas property.

      For example:
         dma-names = "tx", "rx";
