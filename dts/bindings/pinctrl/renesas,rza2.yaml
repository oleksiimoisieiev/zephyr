    Renesas RZ/A2 compined Pin Function and GPIO Controller node
    Pin multiplexing and GPIO configuration is performed on a per-pin basis.
    Each port features up to 8 pins, each of them configurable for GPIO function
    (port mode) or in alternate function mode.
    Up to 8 different alternate function modes exist for each single pin.

        Values are constructed from GPIO port number, pin number, and
        alternate function configuration number using the RZA2_PINMUX()
        helper macro in pinctrl-r7s9210.h.
