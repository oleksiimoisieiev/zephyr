	  Cortex A9 reference manual says (ARM DDI 0388G):
	  The L1 memory system of the Cortex-A9 processor has a local monitor. This is a 2-state, open
	  and exclusive, state machine that manages load/store exclusive (LDREXB, LDREXH, LDREX, LDREXD,
	  STREXB, STREXH, STREX and STREXD) accesses and clear exclusive (CLREX) instructions.

	  At the same time L2 cache PL310 reference manual says (ARM DDI 0246H):
	  The cache controller supports cacheable and non-cacheable exclusive accesses but does not
	  provide an exclusive monitor. The system integrator must implement external exclusive
	  monitors as follows, so that the cache controller can return an EXOKAY response.

	  And, finally, "RZ/A2M Group Userâ€™s Manual: Hardware" (R01UH0746EJ0400 Rev.4.00) says:
	  This LSI does not support atomic access. This restriction means that instructions for
	  exclusive access (LDREX, STREX, LDREXB, STREXB, LDREXD, STREXD, LDREXH, STREXH) and semaphore
	  instructions (SWP, SWPB) cannot be used by the Cortex-A9 in the internal non-cacheable areas.

	  From the previous explanations, it's evident that only the L1 cache has the local monitor,
	  allowing us to utilize exclusive operations solely on cached memory within L1 that lacks the
	  Shareable attribute. For further details, you can refer to the description of the
	  corresponding configuration for ARM32 MMU.
